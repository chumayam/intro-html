    <ol>
      <li>I was born in San Diego, California, but raised in Hawaii.</li>
      <li>I have 3 younger siblings; 2 of them are my younger brothers, Ryan and Tristan, and a dog named Holly. I like to call Holly my younger sibling, because she's my moms' baby.</li>
      <li>Both of my parents came from the Philippines and I never learned to become fluent in Tagalog or Ilocano.</li>
      <li>My favorite site is <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a>!</li>
